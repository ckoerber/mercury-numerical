  abstract={A simple model is presented to explain Higgs boson physics to the grand public. The model consists of a childrenâ€™s ball pool representing a Universe filled with a certain amount of the Higgs field. The model is suitable for usage as a hands-on tool in scientific exhibits and provides a clear explanation of almost all the aspects of the physics of the Higgs field interaction with other particles.}
