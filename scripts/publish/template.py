"""
Template for the simulation of Mercuries orbit.

Sets up the graphics display and defines basic parameters like the position and
velocity of Mercury. Also provides a basic structure for the program to get started
quickly.

All parts that have to be filled in are marked by '### TODO' and brief descriptions
of the tasks.

Basis run parameters are given just before the while loop at the end. They can be
changed freely but the values given have proven to yield good results.
